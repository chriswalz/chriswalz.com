# **Introduction**

This post will be holistic overview. It has an outlook of about 20 to 30 years (assuming it makes it that far). Warning this post is long and in depth because that's the only way to give it a fair analysis. I also plan to treat this post as a live document in order to make adjustments to my analysis as more information becomes available. Also note that I'll attempt to reason by analogy. I'll focus more on a first principles approach. 

I first heard about Elon Musk circa 2008. My cousin was telling me how there's a private space company led by a guy named Elon Musk. It seemed so absurd - how could a private company afford to be launching rockets? Only the government could manage to do something like that. Soon after I ended up reading about Elon Musk. Ever since then I've been an avid listener of his ideas and goals. I believe after studying him for this long I have a strong understanding of his ambitions and his motivations. 

Elon has started many companies. Interestingly, Tesla was not one of them. Tesla ((originally called Tesla Motors, Inc.) was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning neither of which are working at the company anymore although they are both shareholders. It's had a tumultuous history but its still kicking and screaming in 2019. 

Let's take a look at some graphs to get a sense of Tesla' progress since 2010 (when they went public)

All graphs are from https://www.macrotrends.net/ for the timeframe 03/31/2010 to 01/01/2019



# Truthfulness & Biases
In this day and age it's very easy to lie with graphs and numbers. As someone who simply wants to understand the better I will do my best to honest to you as well as with myself. Humans are prone to many biases especially when trying to prove something. 

I also want to acknowledge that I (as is everyone else) is subject to the human condition. I am susceptible to in-group out-group bias, availability bias and confirmation bias as well as my amygdala.

I do my best to reduce the affect of these biases in my analysis.

# A Note on Stock Markets

I believe in a weak version of the EMH - that every stock price is a rough approximation of its true value. I know this a bit controversial; however, the way I see it is that I respect the huge agglomeration of minds that together are in a chaotic yet beautiful constant state of valuing companies. I respect that giant mass of distributed brain power (machines too) and believe it is much smarter than me (at least most of the time 😊). The stock market is considered a level 2 chaotic system so needless to say it's difficult for an observer to predict future value of a stock. Also, humans are emotional (perhaps their algorithmic machines are too). Kahneman in "Thinking Fast and Slow" has some interesting thoughts on this and does give merit to why the markets are NOT very efficient.  

# Electric Vehicles vs. Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles

It's important to think about the automotive market as a whole. Will EV's change the market forever? Or is it just a fad? ICE vehicles have dominated the market ever since horses went out of style. There have been various attempts over the years to move on from ICE using hydrogen fuel cells, hybrids and EV's. I believe that the market will eventually draw towards the best type. How do to define the best? Cost to build, energy efficiency, maintenance costs.  I focus on ICE and EV's in this post.

## Build Costs

construction and recycling

## Energy Efficiency

According to the US Department of Energy’s [Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/evtech.shtml), “EVs convert about 59%–62% of the electrical energy from the grid to power at the wheels. Conventional gasoline vehicles only convert about 17%–21% of the energy stored in gasoline to power at the wheels.”

That means that if an ICE vehicle gets 30MPG an EV would get 90MPGe. 

## Maintenance Costs

# Brand Perception

## Customer Satisfaction 

It may come to no surprised that Tesla drivers are are very happy with their cars even with the horror stories revolving around service centers or price changes soon after purchase. Tesla has a devoted fanbase sometimes its equated to a cult like following. People who post negative content about tesla are often bombared with insults and a slew of dislikes.

# Elon's Compensation Plan

"On January 21, 2018, the board of Tesla, Inc. (Tesla), an electric car and clean energy company,
 approved an unusual executive compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk. Most compensation packages
 for U.S. executives included a mix of a base salary and short- and long-term incentives, but Tesla’s plan
 bucked the norm. Per the plan’s terms, Musk would only be paid if Tesla achieved a series of ambitious
 market capitalization (cap), revenue, and EBITDA milestones. He would receive 1.69 million Tesla
 shares—equivalent to about 1% of total outstanding common stock—if the company’s value (at the
 time, $59 billion) increased to $100 billion and he achieved an operational target (see Exhibit 1 for these
 targets).3 For each additional $50 billion in value that Tesla realized (plus attainment of operational
 targets), Musk would receive an additional 1.69 million company shares. If he met all targets, he stood
 to gain some $55 billion in equity. But if he failed, he would not be compensated at all" - Harvard Business Review

# Long term outlook

Often times it's argued that the long term is more predictable than the short term. 

# Medium term outlook

# Short term outlook


#Some true negative statements about Tesla
Yes, it's valued more than Ford even though Ford's revenue is nearly 8x more.
Yes, they have a debt & cash problem
Yes, their CEO is erratic on Twitter
Yes, they have product quality issues

Yes, these risk factors identified by Tesla

I recommend reading the risk factors filed in Tesla's 10k

#Some negatives claims about Tesla 
They don't have enough demand vs delivery - https://www.fool.com/investing/`019/04/28/elon-musk-comment-should-terrify-tesla-investors.aspx
Full Self Driving (FSD) isn't achievable within 10 years
They open sourced all their patents - any competitor can use their technology
China

# What makes Tesla have potential
EV vehicles are very likely the future. I believe the vast majority of gas cars (if not all) will be replaced EVs by 2050 in the US. (Gov't is incentivized to reduce pollution, reduce dependency on foreign oil, protect its citizens)
Product quality (yes, this was repeated)

Electric Car
Energy efficiency 
Less moving parts. Less maintenance required.
Ice Car 

what patents does it have?

What companies does it own? 

it has 22 billions dollars in assets 

cost cutting, dependency on debt 

# Concluding Thoughts

Whether you hate or love tesla or one of the few who are indifferent, few could argue that Tesla isn't accomplishing their mission - to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. I personally think has had a very strong net good on the world. I hope for their continued success and believe they will succeed which is why I'm an owner of Tesla stock myself. 

Please share you thoughts!
