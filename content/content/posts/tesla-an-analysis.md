### **Introduction**

I first heard about Elon Musk circa 2008. My cousin was telling me how there's a private space company. It seemed so absurd - how could a private company afford to be launching rockets? Only the government could manage to do something like that. Soon after I ended up reading about Elon Musk. It was the first time I ever heard of him. Ever since then I've been an avid listener of his ideas and goals. 
I believe after studying him for this long I have a strong understanding of his ambitions and his motivations. 


Let's focus on Tesla. Tesla (Tesla Motors at the time) was founded in 2003 - and not by Elon Musk. It was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning neither of which are working at the company anymore although they are both shareholders  

### What are my sources?

Wikipedia - yeah it's not "source" but it has good content


### A Note on the Stock Market as a whole

I believe in a weak version of the EMH - that every stock price is a rough approximation of its true value. I know this a bit controversial; however, the way I see it is that I respect the huge agllomeration of minds that together are in a chaotic yet beautiful constant state of valuing companies. I respect for that distributed brain power and believe it is smarter than me (at least most of the time üòä).
The stock market is considered a level 2 chaotic system. There is definitely some emotion (especially fear) involved. 

### Truthfulness & Biases
In this day and age it's very easy to lie with graphs and numbers. As someone who simply wants to understand the better I will do my best to honest to you as well as with myself. Humans are prone to many biases especially when trying to prove something. 

I also want to acknowlede that I (as is everyone else) is subject to the human condition. I am susceptible to in-group out-group bias, availability bias and confirmation bias as well as my amydala.

I do my best to reduce the affect of these biases in my analysis.

### Long term outlook

Often times it's argued that the long term is more predictable than the short term. 

### Medium term outlook

### Short term outlook


####Some true negative statements about Tesla
Yes, it's valued more than Ford even though Ford's revenue is nearly 8x more.
Yes, they have a debt & cash problem
Yes, their CEO is erratic on Twitter
Yes, they have product quality issues

Yes, these risk factors identified by Tesla

These forward-looking statements
are based on management‚Äôs current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially
from those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the
forward-looking statements: the risk of delays in the manufacture, production, delivery and/or completion of our vehicles and energy
products, particularly Model 3; the ability of Tesla to design and grow simultaneous and separate market acceptance of and demand for
Model S, Model X, Model 3 and their variants, as well as new vehicle models such as Model Y; the ability of suppliers to meet quality
and part delivery expectations at increasing volumes, especially with respect to Model 3 parts; adverse foreign exchange movements;
any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; Tesla‚Äôs ability to continue to reduce or control
manufacturing and other costs; consumers‚Äô willingness to adopt electric vehicles; competition in the automotive and energy product
markets generally and the alternative fuel vehicle market and the premium sedan, premium SUV and small to medium-sized sedan
markets in particular; Tesla‚Äôs ability to establish, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand; Tesla‚Äôs ability to manage future growth
effectively as we rapidly grow, especially internationally; the unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic
incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; Tesla‚Äôs ability to establish, maintain and strengthen its relationships with strategic
partners such as Panasonic; potential difficulties in performing and realizing potential benefits under definitive agreements for our
existing and future manufacturing facilities; Tesla‚Äôs ability to maintain schedules, output and cost estimates for our manufacturing
facilities; and Tesla‚Äôs ability to execute on our strategy for new store, service center, Supercharger and other locations and capabilities.
More information on potential factors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our Securities and Exchange
Commission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù in our quarterly report on Form
10-Q filed with the SEC on November 2, 2018. Tesla disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking
statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 

####Some negatives claims about Tesla 
They don't have enough demand vs delivery - https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/28/elon-musk-comment-should-terrify-tesla-investors.aspx
Full Self Driving (FSD) isn't achievable within 10 years
They open sourced all their patents - any competitor can use their technology
China

#### What makes Tesla have potential
EV vehicles are very likely the future. I believe the vast majority of gas cars (if not all) will be replaced EVs by 2050 in the US. (Gov't is incentivized to reduce pollution, reduce dependency on foreign oil, protect its citizens)
This a huge 
Product quality (yes, this was repeated)
