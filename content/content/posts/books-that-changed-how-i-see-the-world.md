### **Introduction**

I first heard about Elon Musk circa 2008. My cousin was telling me how there's a private space company. It seemed so absurd - how could a private company afford to be launching rockets? Only the government could manage to do something like that. Soon after I ended up reading about Elon Musk. It was the first time I ever heard of him. Ever since then I've been an avid listener of his ideas and goals. 
I believe after studying him for this long I have a strong understanding of his ambitions and his motivations. 


Let's focus on Tesla. Tesla (Tesla Motors at the time) was founded in 2003 - and not by Elon Musk. It was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning neither of which are working at the company anymore although they are both shareholders
