### **Introduction**

The feeling of being in the zone or as scientists call it a "flow state" is a beautiful thing. The complete immersion into thought focusing on an activity can you help you be productive. There's nothing worse than an alert sounding off from your phone interrupting your majestic flow state to let you know that there's a $5 discount from Uber if you spend $20. 

So as your might've guessed I value my attention very much and I hope you do as well. But we're not the only one who value our attention span.. billion dollar tech companies value your attention span too - and not for our benefit. So how does one fight back? How do you take control of your own attention when billion dollar companies are in a constant battle for your attention? 

This is not an easy task and not something to take lightly. In this post, I'll take your attention not for my benefit but for yours ðŸ˜‰. Here's how to fight back.
