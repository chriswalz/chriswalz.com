title: How to share passwords or files securely

### **Introduction**

Sometimes it's necessary to share a password or credit number with a friend or family member. If you're like me, you might feel a little apprehensive to share it over text or email but lazy where you dont to make your friend download an app like Signal. 

The easiest way is to use something like [GoSecret.io](https://www.gosecret.io/) or [OneTimeSecret.com](https://onetimesecret.com/).

The main thing to note is that you're sharing a link to the information instead of sharing the information directly. Once the recipient views the message GoSecret takes care of permanently deleting the information from it's database as if the sharing never even happened. OneTimeSecret works in a very similar way. 

You can also share files but that's currently in private beta. Feel free to email me if you're interested in having file sharing as wel (chris@gosecret.io).
