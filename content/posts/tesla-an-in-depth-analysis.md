# Setting the Scene

Tesla is one of the most divisive stocks since it went public in 2010. It has one of the most highly traded stocks with an average volume of 11 million trades everyday. TSLA stock is currently sitting at $190 nearly half of what it was five months ago when Elon famously announced: 

{{< tweet 1026872652290379776 >}}

Three weeks after Elon's famous tweet Tesla published on their [blog](https://www.tesla.com/blog/staying-public) that they would be staying public. Naturally, the stock dropped back down - many investors were quite unhappy. 

Is Tesla ready for a rebound? Or has the death knell sounded marking the end of Tesla's tumultuous journey? 

Some doom sayers such as Morgan Stanley predict the stock will be worth [$10](https://observer.com/2019/05/morgan-stanley-tesla-stock-bear-case-falling-demand/). Others predict it will be worth [$4000](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/04/tesla-could-go-even-higher-than-our-4000-price-target-fund-manager.html) or about $700 million in market value - not too far from Apple and Amazon.  

When there's a lot of controversy it becomes very difficult to sift through all the bullshit. Not one to enjoy reading bullshit, I decided to consolidate my thoughts into this post that lies before your eyes

Through my research one thing I'm sure of is that Tesla is certainly disrupting the automotive industry. We are living in a special time in history. The last time the automotive industry was disrupted like this was in 1908 when the Model T was released. 

# Signposting the Analysis

This post will be a holistic overview. It has an outlook of about 10 to 20 years of the EV industry and Tesla. Warning this post is long. Unlike other posts out there, this isn't about scaring people or clickbait. It's an attempt at a thoughtful analysis focused on fact.  
 
I also plan to treating this post as a live document since I'll make adjustments to my analysis as more information becomes available. Also note that I'll avoid reasoning by analogy. I'll focus more on a first principles approach.

The post is organized in order of the most fundamental aspects that affect Tesla and the automotive industry as a whole starting with the EV industry then Tesla's products then the state of its balance sheet. 

I first heard about Elon Musk circa 2008. My cousin was telling me how there's a private space company led by a guy named Elon Musk. It seemed so absurd - how could a private company afford to be launching rockets? Only the government could manage to do something like that. Soon after I ended up reading about Elon Musk. Ever since then I've been an avid listener of his ideas and goals. I believe after studying him for this long I have a strong understanding of his ambitions and his motivations. 

Elon has started many companies. Interestingly, Tesla was not one of them. Tesla ((originally called Tesla Motors, Inc.) was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning neither of which are working at the company anymore although they are both shareholders. It's had a tumultuous history but its still kicking and screaming in 2019. 

Let's take a look at some graphs to get a sense of Tesla' progress since 2010 (when they went public)

All graphs are from https://www.macrotrends.net/ for the timeframe 03/31/2010 to 01/01/2019



# Truthfulness & Biases
In this day and age it's very easy to lie with graphs and numbers. As someone who simply wants to understand the better I will do my best to honest to you as well as with myself. Humans are prone to many biases especially when trying to prove something. 

I also want to acknowledge that I (as is everyone else) is subject to the human condition. I am susceptible to in-group out-group bias, availability bias and confirmation bias as well as my amygdala.

I do my best to reduce the affect of these biases in my analysis.

# A Note on Stock Markets

I believe in a weak version of the EMH - that every stock price is a rough approximation of its true value. I know this a bit controversial; however, the way I see it is that I respect the huge agglomeration of minds that together are in a chaotic yet beautiful constant state of valuing companies. I respect that giant mass of distributed brain power (machines too) and believe it is much smarter than me (at least most of the time 😊). The stock market is considered a level 2 chaotic system so needless to say it's difficult for an observer to predict future value of a stock. Also, humans are emotional (perhaps their algorithmic machines are too). Kahneman in "Thinking Fast and Slow" has some interesting thoughts on this and does give merit to why the markets are NOT very efficient.  


# Electric Vehicles vs. Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles

It's important to think about the automotive market as a whole. Will EV's change the market forever? Or is it just a fad? ICE vehicles have dominated the market ever since horses went out of style. There have been various attempts over the years to move on from ICE using hydrogen fuel cells, hybrids and EV's. I believe that the market will eventually draw towards the best type. How do to define the best? Cost to build, energy efficiency, maintenance costs.  I focus on ICE and EV's in this post.


## Build Costs

construction and recycling

## Energy Efficiency

According to the US Department of Energy’s [Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/evtech.shtml), “EVs convert about 59%–62% of the electrical energy from the grid to power at the wheels. Conventional gasoline vehicles only convert about 17%–21% of the energy stored in gasoline to power at the wheels.”

That means that if an ICE vehicle gets 30MPG an EV would get 90MPGe.

# Health of Tesla - Financial Document Analysis

## Cash 

Elon Musk semi regular sounds out emails to all of his employees. Some of them are quite positive. Many are alarm bells and scary to read - you can read the full one [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/elon-musk-calls-for-cost-control-in-memo-to-employees.html). I'll highlight a particularly interesting yet unsettling quote here: 

> It is important to bear in mind that we lost $700 million in the first quarter this year, which is over $200 million per month. Investors nonetheless were supportive of our efforts and agreed to give us $2.4 billion (our net proceeds) to show that we can be financially sustainable. 
>
> That is a lot of money, but actually only gives us approximately ten months at the first-quarter burn rate to achieve breakeven. It’s vital that we respect the faith investors have shown in Tesla, but it will require great effort to do so.

Where is all the money going? Let's take a look at a breakdown of their spending



If tesla make is through the short term many of it's R&D will benefit in the future

## Brand Perception

## Customer Satisfaction 

It may come to no surprised that Tesla drivers are are very happy with their cars even with the horror stories revolving around service centers or price changes soon after purchase. Tesla has a devoted fanbase sometimes its equated to a cult like following. People who post negative content about tesla are often bombared with insults and a slew of dislikes.

## The Compensation Plan 

"On January 21, 2018, the board of Tesla, Inc. (Tesla), an electric car and clean energy company,
 approved an unusual executive compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk. Most compensation packages
 for U.S. executives included a mix of a base salary and short- and long-term incentives, but Tesla’s plan
 bucked the norm. Per the plan’s terms, Musk would only be paid if Tesla achieved a series of ambitious
 market capitalization (cap), revenue, and EBITDA milestones. He would receive 1.69 million Tesla
 shares—equivalent to about 1% of total outstanding common stock—if the company’s value (at the
 time, $59 billion) increased to $100 billion and he achieved an operational target (see Exhibit 1 for these
 targets).3 For each additional $50 billion in value that Tesla realized (plus attainment of operational
 targets), Musk would receive an additional 1.69 million company shares. If he met all targets, he stood
 to gain some $55 billion in equity. But if he failed, he would not be compensated at all" - Harvard Business Review

# Long term outlook

Often times it's argued that the long term is more predictable than the short term. 

# Medium term outlook

# Short term outlook


#Some true negative statements about Tesla
Yes, it's valued more than Ford even though Ford's revenue is nearly 8x more.
Yes, they have a debt & cash problem
Yes, their CEO is erratic on Twitter
Yes, they have product quality issues

Yes, these risk factors identified by Tesla

I recommend reading the risk factors filed in Tesla's 10k

#Some negatives claims about Tesla 
They don't have enough demand vs delivery - https://www.fool.com/investing/`019/04/28/elon-musk-comment-should-terrify-tesla-investors.aspx
Full Self Driving (FSD) isn't achievable within 10 years
They open sourced all their patents - any competitor can use their technology
China

#### What makes Tesla have potential
EV vehicles are very likely the future. I believe the vast majority of gas cars (if not all) will be replaced EVs by 2050 in the US. (energy efficiency, Gov't is incentivized to reduce pollution, reduce dependency on foreign oil, protect its citizens) - ener
This a huge 
Product quality (yes, this was repeated)

Electric Car
Energy efficiency 
Less moving parts. Less maintenance required.
Ice Car 

what patents does it have?

What companies does it own? 

it has 22 billions dollars in assets 

cost cutting, dependency on debt 

# Concluding Thoughts

Whether you hate or love tesla, few could argue that Tesla isn't accomplishing their mission - to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. I personally think has had a very strong net good on the world. I hope for their continued success and believe they will succeed which is partly why I own Tesla stock myself. 

Please share you thoughts!
